# CodeClauseInternship_FacialEmotionsDetection
This project, completed as part of my internship with CODECLAUSE, involves developing a facial emotion detection tool that identifies and classifies human emotions based on facial expressions. Utilizing advanced machine learning algorithms and computer vision libraries, this system accurately detects emotions from images or video inputs.

Features-
Emotion Detection: Recognizes and classifies emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, surprise, fear, and neutral expressions.
Real-time Processing: Capable of detecting emotions in real-time from webcam or video feed.
